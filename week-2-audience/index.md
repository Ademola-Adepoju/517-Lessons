# Lesson Outline

**Objective**: Understand readers, scenarios, and tasks and how to accommodate both when writing technical content. Discuss how “every page is page one” philosophy changes awareness of audience and task. Examine examples of writing for different audiences and tasks to determine stylistic differences.

## 1. GitHub and VSC

### 1.1. Install [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extension

### 1.2.  GitHub basics (repos, branching, commits, pull requests, merging)

- [ ] Clone a repo in VSC / GitHub Desktop (including file location)
- [ ] Fetching files from GitHub
- [ ] Branching the repo
- [ ] Staging, commenting, and pushing changes
- [ ] Reviewing and merging changes in GitHub

## 2. Types of Readers

### 2.1 Lecture

Redish (1989) – three types of readers with different purposes and that are accommodated in different ways through the text

- Read to do: 
  - Reading to extract information for immediate use
  - No need to recall, little patience for long passages
- Read to learn: 
  - Reading for understanding and to recall later
  - More patience for explanation and longer passages
- Read to learn to do: 
  - Read to understand and later recall in the context of their own tasks. 
  - Will read longer passages but need a context of a real tasks and sense of motivation. 
  - Readers will satisfice.

### 2.2 Discussion

1. How do you expect that texts accommodating these readers will differ either in content or style? What specific, observable differences would you expect?
2. Consider some of the habits of readers who are accessing information in the ways that more recent research has described. Do Redish's categories of readers still matter 30 years later? Why or why not?

   - Readers are information foragers
   - Readers want information in isolated, portable chunks
   - Readers access and interpret information through the lens of communities
   - Readers pull content rather than having it pushed on them
   - Readers use information to collaborate/cooperate with others

### 2.3 Exercise I: Understanding Audience

I have uploaded pieces of documentation from the SAS Studio software. Read them all and tell me the following:

- Which of these are for a read to do audience? (Example ? folder)
- Which of these are for a read to learn audience? (Example ? folder)
- Which of these are for a read to learn to do audience? (Example ? folder)
- How do the groups differ from each other stylistically?

## 3. Understanding Readers

### 3.1 Lecture

From another publication by Ginny Redish, she further characterizes what we need to know about audiences:

“Readers decide how much attention to page to a document” (p.15)
- Readers only read as much as they need to read
- Make sure they get what they want before leaving
- Be sure of why you are writing to them

“Reader use documents as tools” (p.18)
- Readers read in order to do something other than read
- Readers want information quickly
- Readers rely on tools/structures for access

“Readers actively interpret as they read” (p.22)
- Readers bring their own needs, biases, and expectations
- Readers are situated in their tasks
- Understand these interpretations and shape them by addressing them

“Readers interpret documents in light of their own knowledge and expectations” (p. 27)
- Apply schema or rules for understanding the content
- Plan ahead and provide your own explicit schema
- Understand readers well enough to accommodate their schema (p.27)

### 3.2 Discussion

- What are things that you could do (or have) done in technical writing to accommodate audiences with these characteristics?

### 3.3 Exercise II: Accommodating an audience

Go to the Student User Guide for MyPack Portal (https://sis.emas.ncsu.edu/students/)

**Scenario**: you are enrolled in a class that is difficult to get into but you really want a seat in a different class that is waitlisted. The two classes are at the same day and time so you can't enroll in both. How can you set up your register for the waitlisted class automatically while dropping the course you are currently in.

Search however you can on the NC State site. Choose the first link that goes to a page of content from Student Services.

Evaluate the site without scrolling:
- How likely is it that this page has the information you seek?
- Is this page worth the energy spent to review the content?

Scroll and browse the rest of the content:

- How does the page either assure you that you have found the information you seek?
- If the page does not have the information you seek, does it re-direct you?
- To what degree is the page written to accommodate your needs/biases?
- How well does the page work as "page one"?
